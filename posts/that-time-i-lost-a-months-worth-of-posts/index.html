<p>Remember that one time I decided to start blogging in earnest on my own domain as a static hugo site
but I changed computers and didn&rsquo;t push the source changes to github so I lost a month&rsquo;s worth of blog posts?</p>
<p>Good times.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually kind of funny because I wrote this whole 6 part series on cloning
twitter but it wasn&rsquo;t really that good, I kind of phoned home for most of it, I don&rsquo;t
have to worry about it anymore though, because that&rsquo;s that. I deleted the first four parts
because I&rsquo;ll never recover the final two so there it is.</p>
<p>The good news is that I think this is the final push for me to really invest in a personal
blog that runs on top of sqlite and has automatic daily backup via cron to backblaze b2,
similar to what I do with janetdocs.</p>
<p>Or it could be a good time to record a video and put it on youtube going through the code
I already wrote for the twitter clone OR it could be a great time to drop everything and give
up trying to make money on the internet with saas software.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t decided yet.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll know if my online presence goes dark, actually you won&rsquo;t.</p>
