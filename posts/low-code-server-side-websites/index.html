    <h1 id="low-code-server-side-websites">Low Code Server Side Websites</h1>
<p>One overarching goal of mine ever since I got into this web development game &gt; 10 years ago after graduating as an electrical engineer was to make making websites the easiest it could possibly be. I started with rails, and that isn&rsquo;t the easiest place to start if you don&rsquo;t already understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>sql</li>
<li>html</li>
<li>css</li>
<li>javascript</li>
<li>html forms</li>
<li>http</li>
<li>background jobs</li>
<li>websockets</li>
</ul>
<p>and how each of those parts fit together to make a great website or I guess you could call them web apps.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of room for improvement in the number of keystrokes to deployed website metric there. Rails tries to help by generating a bunch of text, but the sheer amount of text you need to get something done is still a barrier to entry for most individual website makers, or you could shorten that to indie web makers or even indie makers.</p>
<p>So for the past I don&rsquo;t know how many years I&rsquo;ve been studying up on languages and possible technologies that I could use to make websites with the least amount of keystrokes. One possibility was clojure and I dove into that face first. It did work, I noticed a substantial reduction in number of keystrokes, but there was still this strange formalism that I couldn&rsquo;t shake, a duplication of namespaces repeated across every file, and believe you me, there were a <em>lot</em> of files. I learned a few things from those clojure years:</p>
<ul>
<li>sqlite is enough</li>
<li>the jvm is more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth for small to medium websites (the 99%, of which I am one of)</li>
<li>clojure itself felt formal and rigid even with macros</li>
<li>single file websites are the holy grail</li>
</ul>
<p>One very productive person (tm) who you have probably heard of, <a href="https://levels.io">Pieter Levels</a>, also honed in on these aspects of web development, sqlite + single file. He uses php 7 which is interesting, but I never learned php, so not sure it would help me here.</p>
<p>One &ldquo;web framework&rdquo; that has always been interesting to me is <a href="sinatrarb.com">sinatra</a>. So I remade it in <a href="https://janet-lang.org">janet</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently calling it <a href="https://github.com/swlkr/osprey">osprey</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still really early days, and things will change, but <a href="https://github.com/swlkr/osprey/discussions">let me know what you think</a>!</p>
