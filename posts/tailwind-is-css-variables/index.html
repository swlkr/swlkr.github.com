<p>My argument against tailwind and all atomic css is that it can be reduced even further to just using regular css and css variables. Yes you will have to use a separate file instead of your template or html file, but isn’t that what split panes are for?</p>
<p>I still think there is a place for atomic classes, mostly for margin/padding and things like that, but for the most part you should probably just use grid and flexbox for layout and then everything else should be a css variable. A good rule of thumb is to make sure you never have a hardcoded number in your css, always reference a variable. This keeps your design consistent.</p>
<p>The key to consistency isn’t using a framework it’s choosing</p>
<ul>
<li>spacing scale (padding/margin)</li>
<li>shadows</li>
<li>borders</li>
<li>colors</li>
<li>font scale</li>
</ul>
<p>ahead of time and assigning them to css variables, and only referencing those variables.</p>
<p>I’ve found I can move even faster without tailwind by just copying most of their css variables and writing a mix of classless css, atomic css, flexbox and grid. You should try it!</p>
