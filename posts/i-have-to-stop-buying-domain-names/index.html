    <h1 id="i-have-to-stop-buying-domains">I have to stop buying domains</h1>
<p>I bought three domains over the last two weeks:</p>
<ol>
<li>seans dot cloud</li>
<li>isatiny dot app</li>
<li>isatiny dot com</li>
</ol>
<p>The first one is weird mostly because my name is not phonetic so as I soon as I bought it for $4 I knew
it sucked, but it was already too late.</p>
<p>Hopefully the last two will be the last two I will ever buy because I own about 40 domains
and I let most of the them expire every year becuase I don&rsquo;t want to pay the $8/year to keep them around.</p>
<p>This is the cycle that I&rsquo;m sure someone reading this particular blog is familiar with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Live your life: take a walk, workout, do chores, take a shower, whatever</li>
<li>Get a brilliant flash of insight about a problem you may have had while doing a thing</li>
<li>Get pumped on this new idea</li>
<li>Check for available domain names related to this idea</li>
<li>Go through extensive lists of synonyms and variations: random prefixes or suffixes</li>
<li>Find one or two</li>
<li>Buy domain</li>
<li>Start coding immediately</li>
<li>Days, weeks or months go by</li>
<li>Burn out on the idea, could be doubts creeping in, could be a realization that user/customer acquisition is still difficult</li>
<li>Step away from the computer</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure how to break out of this cycle. One idea I had was to just do nothing
when I get some stupid flash of insight on a &ldquo;problem&rdquo; that I have. I&rsquo;ve resisted buying a ton of domains
over the last few years because if I just let the idea go I usually go through the whole cycle and reach the
&ldquo;burn out&rdquo; point without even writing a single line of code.</p>
<p>There are larger concerns here around what it means to be a &ldquo;maker&rdquo; or a &ldquo;doer&rdquo; in a world that is highly automated
and requires very little labor to meet our basic needs and even more complicated needs. That could be a whole other post.</p>
<p>The point is, when I feel the urge to buy a domain and start another stupid project I&rsquo;m going to just slap a subdomain on &ldquo;isatiny.app&rdquo;
when I go to deploy some code instead of wasting time with naming I can just use the most straightforward name possible.</p>
<p>Oh also I&rsquo;m currently in the &ldquo;Start coding immediately&rdquo; phase of my latest project: ping.isatiny.app</p>
<p>Send help.</p>
