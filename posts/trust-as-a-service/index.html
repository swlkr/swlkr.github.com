    <h1 id="saas-is-taas">SaaS is TaaS</h1>
<p>After trying and failing for quite a while, much longer than most people to build a SaaS, you could say i’m SaaD. I’ve also learned a thing or two about failing, and one thing i’ve learned is that software businesses aren’t really about software, they’re about trust.</p>
<ul>
<li>Build an audience</li>
<li>Work in public</li>
<li>High touch sales</li>
</ul>
<p>All of those things are the same thing. They’re helping you build trust between you and your future customers. In a world where there are 10,000 SaaS apps for any given category, the only thing separating the GLaaD ones from the SaaD ones is trust.</p>
<p>So don’t just start making a SaaS in your room by yourself, turn on your webcam and stream. Record a youtube video. Live tweet. Do something to get the word out that you’re making something. I have a theory that the success of a SaaS is directly proportional to how much communication you do throughout the build process.</p>
<p>Take this example.</p>
<p>If you live stream everyday for an hour everyday while you’re building it, you have a much higher chance of success than if you worked on it for 8 hours a day and just posted it to product hunt, reddit and HN at the end.</p>
<p>So don’t just make your side project, build an audience by building in public, and don’t be SaaD like me, build trust.</p>
<p>If only there were Software as a Service that could gain you Trust as a Service.</p>
