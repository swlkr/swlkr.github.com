<p>I could have also named this, what the heck is all of this b2b saas security stuff and how can I compete in this market?</p>
<p>I know about the edges of this market but I didn&rsquo;t know (and still don&rsquo;t know) a ton about how it works or what&rsquo;s worth paying for, or in the words of at least one famous influencer, what&rsquo;s the different between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin</li>
<li>Painkiller</li>
</ul>
<p>in this weird, B2B SaaS security space.</p>
<p>Also this blog post is my first attempt at getting some traffic for this specific idea, although I think I can use adwords if I charge enough?</p>
<p>Stay with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll lay out what the point of this stuff is first, like what problems the stuff is supposed to be solving and then I&rsquo;ll talk about the &ldquo;products&rdquo; themselves.</p>
<p>I think this market is great for three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sometimes these enterprise deals can&rsquo;t close until you get SOC2/HIPAA/ISO27001 accreditation</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a pain in the butt to gather all of these docs together and to stay compliant year after year</li>
<li>Some of these companies are paying in excess of $100k / year to ease the pain</li>
</ol>
<p>So this is great, right? Money is changing hands, (a lot of it), the theoretical market is growing because there are more and more B2B SaaS companies every year at least I think there are and there&rsquo;s legal stuff involved which means barrier to entry / high complexity. I love this so far!</p>
<p>So the bad news is there are a <em>ton</em> of competitors with deep pockets and huge teams.</p>
