    <h1>Ask Janet</h1>

<p>The question in a world of abundance is &quot;why?&quot;. What is the point of making yet another website?</p>

<p>Well, I don&#39;t have 1500 reputation on stackoverflow, so I can&#39;t make a janet tag, and I would also like to stop searching through gitter for questions/answers. I feel like those are perfectly reasonable reasons to make a website.</p>

<p>With that, I set out to use my ✨shiny ✨new web framework <a href="https://joyframework.com">joy</a> to recreate some of the bits of SO, but specifically for janet.</p>

<p>The first thing I think that&#39;s really cool about joy and about the stack in general is the low memory usage: 11280 kb on a raspberry pi. No clouds here, just tiny computers serving the internet.</p>

<p>I mean sure a blank joy app only uses 5 MB, but 12 MB is nothing to sneeze at, and this is with some pretty FAT sqlite queries, loading quite a bit of data into memory. Not to mention, CSRF protection, full blown encrypted cookies w/ sessions, I mean if you can imagine a web framework feature, this thing has it. So, now that I can run websites off of my raspberry pi, which is $35 and not a $5/mo VPS, what&#39;s next?</p>

<p>The stack still needs a little tweaking, for starters, it&#39;s ugly. There&#39;s no doubt about it, <a href="https://www.cssbed.com/water.css-dark/">water.css</a> is great for fast prototyping with a dark mode, but it comes at the expense of a few rough edges. I&#39;m looking toward <a href="https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/">mvp.css</a> for my next project.</p>

<p>The rest of the stuff can definitely stay though, I love <a href="https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine">alpine.js</a>, it&#39;s the perfect &quot;framework&quot; for already server rendered html. I&#39;m also going to bring in turbolinks, assuming I can get rid of any flashes of unstyled content.</p>

<p>The stack is here to stay, I&#39;m super happy with how fast things come together:</p>
